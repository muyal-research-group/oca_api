# OCA - API  v1
An observatory is an object that contain N catalogs. This object is used in the user interface to create a page dinamically. The catalogs are use to match products that are listed in the UI. We can use the values in the catalogs to create queries. You can se an example of an observatory at [here](https://muyal.tamps.cinvestav.mx/observatories). You need to have an account please contact me a at jesus.castillo.b@cinvestav.mx to request your account.

So in code an observatory has a simple structure like this: 
```python
class Observatory:
    obid:str
    title: str
    image_url:str
    description:str
    catalogs:List[LevelCatalog]
    disabled:bool 
```

You can create one of this using this [endpoint](https://alpha.tamps.cinvestav.mx/ocapi/redoc#operation/create_observatory_observatories_post). 

# Catalog - API 

A catalog is a collection of values. Catalogs has an special attribute that define its ```kind```. We use this attribute to perform advanced queries.
```python
class Catalog:
    cid:str
    display_name:str 
    items: List[CatalogItem]
    kind:str 
```

You can create a catalog using this [endpoint](https://alpha.tamps.cinvestav.mx/ocapi/redoc#operation/create_catalogs_catalogs_post). ⚠️ The supported ```kind``` values are the followin: ```TEMPORAL```, ```SPATIAL```, ```INTEREST```, ```INTEREST_NUMERIC```. 

# Product - API 
A product can be anything you want, you defined like this:
```python
class Product(BaseModel):
    pid:str # Product unique identifier
    description:str # A simple description
    levels:List[Level] # levels defined later
    product_type: str # the type of the product
    level_path:str # xD the name of the levels (e.g CIE10.SEXO)
    profile:str # The value of the levels (e.g C50.MUJER)
    product_name: str # Name of the product xd 
    tags:List[str] # Tags for advancing permission control
```

The product has levels, this are defined like this:
```python
class Level(BaseModel):
    index:int # this value determines the position in the user interface.
    cid:str # The unique identifier of the catalog for this level.
    value:str # The value in the catalog
    kind:str # the kind of the level maybe spatial, temporal, and so on.
```

You can create may products in bulk using the next [endpoint](https://alpha.tamps.cinvestav.mx/ocapi/redoc#operation/create_products_products_post).
